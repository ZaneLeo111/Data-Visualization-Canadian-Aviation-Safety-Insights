# Overview
This repository contains a series of data visualizations that analyze aviation occurrences in Canada over the last 25 years, with a focus on the last decade (2012-2022). These visualizations aim to identify trends and insights related to aircraft accidents and incidents, helping to answer the key question: “Where should efforts be focused to improve the safety of Canadian airspace?”

# Data Source
The dataset includes information on various commercial and private aviation occurrences such as emergency landings, runway excursions, and mid-air collisions across Canada. Each record details the aircraft involved, occurrence time, location, damage extent, and injuries.

# Visualizations Included
Visualization 1: Top 10 Models by Accident Frequency
This visualization identifies the aircraft models most frequently involved in accidents from 2012 to 2022. Notably, the DHC-8 series appears prominently, suggesting potential issues in its design or manufacturing that merit closer examination.

## Visualization 2: Annual Incident Trends for Top Models
An explanatory chart displays the annual incident counts for the top 10 models. A marked decline in incidents post-2019 for models DHC-8-400 and DHC-8-300 suggests improvements have been made. However, the DHC-8-400 continues to show a relatively high rate of incidents, underscoring the need for ongoing investigation.

## Visualization 3: Common Causes of Incidents
Analysis from 2020 to 2022 indicates that "EMERGENCY/PRIORITY" and "DIFFICULT TO CONTROL" are common incident causes, especially for the DHC-8-400 model. These findings direct urgent attention towards understanding and mitigating these issues.

## Visualization 4: Incident/Accident Locations
Tableau visualizations illustrate the geographical distribution of incidents, highlighting areas with abnormal incident frequencies, particularly around the Canada-US border. This raises questions about regional safety disparities and suggests a focus area for further safety enhancements.

# Recommendations
Based on the insights from these visualizations, it is recommended to:

Further investigate the DHC-8 series, especially the DHC-8-400 model, to understand and address the high incidence rates.  
Analyze the causes labeled as "EMERGENCY/PRIORITY" for the DHC-8-400 to implement targeted improvements.  
Explore regional safety issues near the Canada-US border to determine if specific measures are needed in this area.
